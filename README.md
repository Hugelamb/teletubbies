# What is a DDoS attack?
DDoS, or Distributed Denial of Service attacks, are network attacks designed to exhaust the resources of a target application by flooding the target ip with useless traffic, degrading the functionality of the site due to increased traffic, or in some cases, causing the website to be taken offline due to the overwhelming internet traffic. 

# How can a DDoS attack be detected?
No defined methods, however several factors can signal a possible DDoS attack, including:
+ sudden spike in web traffic from same IP address or range of addresses.
+ Slow or highly variable network performance
+ Loss of functionality or user experience degradation.
